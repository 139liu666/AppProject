# AppProject
This is a movie data application developed with **Jetpack Compose**.   
It uses a **remote API** for authentication and data storage, and also stores login data locally.   
The app can display the currently most popular movies and TV series. Users can tap an item to enter a detail page, use the search feature, and add movies or TV series to their favorites and watched lists.
